As part of our interview process we would like for you to write a solution to the following problem, focusing on correctness and speed. As described in the details below, you may choose your language of choice -- we've listed several good options. 
 
Please reply to this email with your solution as source code, and including the (2) longest words that the program finds, and any comments you have on the approach you took. 
 
If you have any questions about the problem, please feel free to email us back. 
 
Thank you.

Programming Problem - Find Longest Word Made of Other Words 
====================== 
 
Write a program that reads a file containing a sorted list of words (one 
word per line, no spaces, all lower case), then identifies the longest 
word in the file that can be constructed by concatenating copies of 
shorter words also found in the file. 
 
For example, if the file contained: 
 
       cat 
       cats 
       catsdogcats 
       catxdogcatsrat 
       dog 
       dogcatsdog 
       hippopotamuses 
       rat 
       ratcatdogcat 
 
The answer would be 'ratcatdogcat' - at 12 letters, it is the longest 
word made up of other words in the list.  The program should then 
go on to report how many of the words in the list can be constructed  
of other words in the list. 
 
Please send your solution in source code form, written in one of the 
following languages: C, C++, Java, Python, or Ruby.   This is not just a  
puzzle or classroom assignment; it is your opportunity to demonstrate  
your engineering judgment in a way that you cannot do in a personal 
 interview.  Performance matters: the program should return results  
quickly even for very large lists (100,000+ items).   
 
Please find attached a file, words.zip, containing a word list, words.txt,  
with 173k rows, for testing purposes.
